  "description": "This package contains a library which specifies the semantics of regular expressions and regular expression matching in a high-level manner via non-deterministic operations. This library might be useful as an oracle to test more efficient regular expression matchers. Furthermore, there is also a library which is used by the Curry preprocessor to translate regular expression in POSIX syntax occurring as integrated code in Curry programs.",
